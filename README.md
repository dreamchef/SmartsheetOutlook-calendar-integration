# Rolling Scheduler Integration for Smartsheet and Microsoft Outlook Calendar

Calendar scheduling tool that uses Python to connect between the Smartsheet API and the Microsoft Outlook native application, created for use by pre-sales and enterprise delivery professionals during my tenure at RSM US LLP.

The core differentiating feature is the ability to handle and handle conflicts between meetings scheduled in the Smartsheet and Outlook Calendar platforms.

The [assets](https://github.com/dreamchef/rolling-scheduler/tree/main/assets) folder contains Python scripts which handle moving events on the Calendar from Smartsheet to Outlook, vice versa, and detecting conflicts between meetings.

The batch files allow easy execution of the scripts from the desktop for a typical user.
